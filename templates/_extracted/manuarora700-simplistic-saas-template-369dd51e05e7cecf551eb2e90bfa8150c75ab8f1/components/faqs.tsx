        question: "How much does it cost to deploy AI agents?",
        answer:
          "Our pricing starts at $49/month for the Starter plan which includes up to 5 AI agents and 10,000 task executions. Scale plans start at $199/month for unlimited agents and 100,000 executions. Enterprise pricing is available for high-volume needs.",

      {
        question: "Is there a free trial available?",
        answer:
          "Yes, we offer a 14-day free trial with full access to all features. No credit card required to get started. You can deploy up to 3 AI agents during the trial period.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if I exceed my plan limits?",
        answer:
          "We'll notify you when you reach 80% of your limits. If you exceed them, your agents will continue running but new task executions will be queued until the next billing cycle or until you upgrade your plan.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I change plans at any time?",
        answer:
          "You can upgrade your plan at any time and the new features will be available immediately. Downgrades take effect at the start of your next billing cycle. We prorate charges for mid-cycle upgrades.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer refunds?",
        answer:
          "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for annual plans. Monthly plans can be cancelled at any time with no refund, but you'll retain access until the end of your billing period.",

        question: "What can AI agents automate?",
        answer:
          "Our AI agents can automate complex workflows including data processing, customer support responses, content generation, scheduling, monitoring systems, and multi-step decision making. They work autonomously while you sleep, handling tasks that would typically require human intervention.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I deploy and orchestrate my agents?",
        answer:
          "Deploying agents is simple. Use our visual workflow builder or SDK to define agent behaviors, then deploy with a single click. Our orchestration layer handles scaling, failovers, and inter-agent communication automatically.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can agents make autonomous decisions?",
        answer:
          "Yes, agents are designed to make intelligent decisions based on the rules and parameters you configure. You can set decision boundaries, approval thresholds, and fallback behaviors. Critical decisions can be routed for human review before execution.",

      },
      {
        question: "Are you GDPR compliant?",
        answer:
